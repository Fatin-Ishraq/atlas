Yet, amidst the cacophony, my thoughts drift to you, to the scent of lavender in our garden, to the warmth of your hand in mine. \n\nDo you remember the old oak by the river? I find myself sketching it in my mind, its sturdy branches a symbol of the endurance I pray for. Tell little Arthur I carry his drawing of a 'brave soldier' in my breast pocket. It is a finer shield than any armour.\n\nKeep the home fires burning, my love. Your letters are beacons in this endless night. Until we meet again, hold fast to hope. \n\nYours forever,\nThomas",

But the sight of land this morning – a sliver of hope on the horizon – stirred something new within me.\n\nThey call this a new world. It feels raw, untamed, vast. I carry with me my mother's worn prayer book and a pouch of soil from our old farm. Small anchors in an ocean of uncertainty. I shall write of what I find here, for those who may follow, or for those who simply remember.\n\nMay fortitude be my companion.",
